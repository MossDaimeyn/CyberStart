### Race To Where
Here's an interesting one for you agent - on the weekend the gang released what looks like a one page website advertising an upcoming bike race they're organising. Being cyber detectives we're naturally curious that things might not be as they seem. Have a look at the site - it looks like there are just two images on the page, a logo and the poster, can you **find** anything suspicious, maybe **some text?**

**Tip:** Find the **hidden** clue and it'll lead you to the flag.

```
After selecting all the pages, we found there was a hidden text "/secret.html" on the page.
So include this after the given url like "https://www.canalbikerace.com/secret.html".
