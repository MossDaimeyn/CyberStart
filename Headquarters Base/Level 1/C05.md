### Mixed Messages

Our team have been monitoring some text message chatter between two of the senior gang members over the last week. There was nothing interesting of note until suddenly all their messages started coming through **mixed up**.

At first we thought it might be a technical problem, but then it occurred to us that they might be deliberately **encoding the messages** somehow.

I've had one of the agents forward you one of the messages, see if you can **decode it**.

**Tip:** **Decode the message**, we think it mentions **two colors**, combine them (e.g. **redgreen**) and that's the flag.

Encoded message : IBEK OCLLCEITNO EW LPNA OT ATEK SI LBEU RO EYLLWO

As far as, we observed that the words in the message are jumbled. So, when we try to decode it, we found:

Decoded message : KEBI ONTIECLLOCO we plan to take is blue or yellow  

According to given tip,  flag must be "blueyellow"
