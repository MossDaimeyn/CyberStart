### Social Secret
Agent, we think we might have a way to log into a social media account of one of the gang using the site's password reset form. We have two key pieces of information: his **username** and his **favourite color**. We just need his **age** and we'll be able to log in - can you **guess it from the information we already have**?

**Tip:** **Get the age correct** and submit the form to get the flag.

We can clearly see the username which is lars_1986, so 1986 must be birst year so the correct age would be (2022-1986) = 36
