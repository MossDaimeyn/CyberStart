### Executable

Agent, quick question for you. One of the team sent me a screenshot of his filesystem browser with a bunch of files she recovered from a memory stick one of the gang discarded. She's asking if any of them are **executable files**. Take a look and let me know.

**Tip:** The **name of the executable file (including the extension)** is the flag.

So, the file that was executable was :

old-bike-parts.com
