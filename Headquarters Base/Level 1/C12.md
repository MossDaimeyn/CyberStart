### Binary Bike Lock
Well, this gang loves their technology and bikes so much that they've combined them to make a custom bike lock!

We're concerned they're going to use this lock technology as part of the bigger bike heist, so it's worth us taking the time to try and figure out how to crack them now.

Take a look at this lock and see if you can unlock it.

**Tip:** **Unlock the bike lock** to get the flag.
