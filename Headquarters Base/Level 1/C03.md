### Happy Customers
During our initial analysis of the gang we noticed something strange - they created lists of their customers and shared it between their bike shops, and each customer had a unique pattern of numbers after their name. One of our agents thinks the pattern of numbers might be **encoded words**. We also noticed the **numbers never went above 26**, that might be relevant. Can you work out what it means?

**Tip:** **Decode the message** to get the secret word and use that as the flag.

We may observe from the hint that 26 were all less than or equal to 26 and total number of alphabets are also 23. So, we may conclude 1=A, 2=B, 3=C,..........26=Z
