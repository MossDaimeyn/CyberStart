### Hard Hash

Agent D from our cryptography department has just sent me this **hash** she intercepted from an exchange between two Slootmaeker gang members. She thought it might be a good task for a smart agent like yourself to figure out.

**Tip:** Maybe someone has **already figured out** what this is a hash of. Sometimes the work of the CPA starts with an **internet search**.
