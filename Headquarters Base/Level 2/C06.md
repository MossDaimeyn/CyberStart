### Broken Click

Here's a weird one agent, there's now a **link** on the Slootmaekers login page for an **admin login**. We wanted to take a look but the link **doesn't seem to work**. Can you figure out how to get to it?

**Tip:** **Get to the admin login page** to get the flag.

```
When we hover to 'Admin login', we observe a link at left lower corner.
Enter that link in the adress bar.
