### More Broken Bicycles

Remember the blog post by Lars De Vries from the last floor? Well, we thought we'd figured out what the issue was with the broken images on the site, but on this page that we've just come across **all the images already have file extensions**, but **one is still broken**. Can you see what's wrong?

**Tip:** **Get the image to show** to get the flag.

![image](CyberStart/Headquarters%20Base/Level%202/img/c05image.png)

```
The image was broken because its extension was '.gif' instead of '.jpg'.

Change the extension of inage from '.gif' to '.jpg' using inspect element.
