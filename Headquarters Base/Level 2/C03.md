### Secret Pages

You're now well aware of the Slootmaekers supposedly legit business, the Bike Factory. Evidence is mounting up that the business, and especially its website, have quite a few things to hide. We've just had a tip-off that there's a **secret page** on the website with some interesting information about when the gang plan to attempt the eBike heist. Problem is, it seems to be **restricted**. Can you get access?

**Tip:** **Get access to the page** to get the flag.
