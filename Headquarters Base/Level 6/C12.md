### Brute Strength

Great news, recruit. Thanks to your work we've been able to recover a zip file from the Yakoottees' private server. We're looking for blueprints of the Superspin HQ and details of how they plan to get in. Hopefully, the zip contents will lead us to that.

The zip file is password protected, so we set one of our engineers on writing a script to brute force it. Unfortunately, he was called away onto a special project for a team on another level. Perhaps you could make the final few alterations to his script to get it working.

**Tip:** Change the script and open up the zip file to get the flag. Oh, and don't forget you can use your local terminal to help.


```
Change 
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
to 
alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
```


Code:-
```python
import zipfile
import itertools
import time

# Function for extracting zip files to test if the password works!
def extractFile(zip_file, password):
    try:
        zip_file.extractall(pwd=password.encode())
        return True
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        pass

# Main code starts here...
# The file name of the zip file.
zipfilename = 'planz.zip'
# The first part of the password. We know this for sure!
first_half_password = 'Super'
# We don't know what characters they add afterwards...
# This is case sensitive!
alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile(zipfilename)

# We know they always have 3 characters after Super...
# For every possible combination of 3 letters from alphabet...
for c in itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=3):
    # Add the three letters to the first half of the password.
    password = first_half_password+''.join(c)
    # Try to extract the file.
    print("Trying: %s" % password)
    # If the file was extracted, you found the right password.
    if extractFile(zip_file, password):
        print('*' * 20)
        print('Password found: %s' % password)
        print('Files extracted...')
        exit(0)

# If no password was found by the end, let us know!
print('Password not found.')
```

```
Password found: SupermAN
