### Lost Key

Our agent on the ground noticed a USB key discarded outside The Yakoottees' garage and he's just uploaded the files for analysis. It's probably nothing important; they just look like innocent jpg files. One looks corrupt, however. Can you take a look just to be sure we don't miss anything?

**Tip:** The flag is in the file.
