### QR.gif

Remember the QR code that the Yakoottees printed on a T-shirt? You might have been assigned to investigate it on the previous level. Well, it looks like they're using QR codes again and they've gone one step further by embedding them in a GIF file. We think the combined output is important, so get straight on it recruit.

**Tip:** Work out the QR codes and put them together for the flag.

```
Step 1 : Extract frames from gif.
Step 2 : Read those frames using QR scanner.
Step 3 : Frame 1 ->  mAr10_
		 Frame 2 ->  i5_
		 Frame 3 ->  a_
		 Frame 4 ->  br0
Step 4 : Merge all frames : mAr10_i5_a_br0
```
