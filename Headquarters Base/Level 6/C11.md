### Still Hiding

Were you involved in the previous level when we needed someone to SSH into one of the Yakoottees' servers and take a look around? Well, we need to do it again. It seems they're becoming a little smarter about hiding their files. Take a look and see what you can find.

SSH sessions only last 60 minutes, after that you will need to reload the page to get a new one.

**Time Left:** 40 minutes  

These are the details you'll need:

**Username:** TMtjArUsoa  
**Password:** Ow0TFPNtdA  
**IP Address:** 54.195.167.30  
**Port:** 39542  

**Tip:** The flag is in a file somewhere on the server.
