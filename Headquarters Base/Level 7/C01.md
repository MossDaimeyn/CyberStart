It's time to go old-school, recruit.

We think the Chiquitoos have an insider that works on the ships carrying the shipping containers full of Cola. Obviously they don't want to be found out while passing details to the gang members on the nearby reconnaissance boats, so they've resorted to using Morse code to communicate. We've tapped into the frequency they're using and funnelled the code into our Morse code tool. Decipher the message and see what they're saying.

**Tip:** In the message they mention a ship name; that's the flag.

```
Go to source code and copy that:
- .... .. ... / .. ... / --. --- -. --.. .- .-.. . --.. / . -..- .--. .-.. --- .-. .. -. --. / . -. - .-. -.-- / --- .--. - .. --- -. ... / .- -... --- .- .-. -.. / ... .... .. .--. / -.-. .- .-.. .-.. . -.. / . ... -.-. .- -... .- .-. / --- ...- . .-.
