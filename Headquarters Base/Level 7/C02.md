### Hidden Boats

Those Chiquitoos are a busy gang and they run a number of legitimate and criminal operations. One of their legitimate businesses is a small boating company that transports workers to the offshore wind farm. Their website has a page, which lists all the scheduled trips out, but we think there might be more that they're not making public. Our inside informant tells us they're stored in a file called "extra.txt". Have a look at the site and see if you can get access to it.

**Tip:** The flag is the boat number of the last one in the secret list.
