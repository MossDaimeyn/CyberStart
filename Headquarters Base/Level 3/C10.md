### The Competitor Revealed

We've intercepted some encrypted text from one of the gang members, which we think might include the **name of the competitor company** that they intend to target.

We know it uses a letter **Substitution Cipher** and luckily we have some **Frequency Analysis** counts. At CPA we have our very own tool for helping agents to break this kind of encryption. Use it to try and work out what the text says.

**Tip:** The flag is the name of the competitor company.
