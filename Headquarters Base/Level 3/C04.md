### Confused

Recruit, we've intercepted some chatter between Chopper gang members talking about one of their competitor's machines. They all have unique identifiers and we think one of those identifiers is **hidden in some code** we found. One of the other agents has emailed it to you. Take a look and see if you can **find the identifier**.

**Tip:** The identifier is the flag you need.

Hey there,

I've been staring at this seemingly encrypted message we intercepted all day and just can't seem to crack it. It's so short it should be simple, but for some reason it's eluding me.

I was chatting to Agent J this morning, we grabbed a coffee on the top floor so I could give him an update on our surveillance of the Choppers, and he mentioned you were good with this sort of thing. Fancy taking a look for me?

Here it is, just one block of code. Should be simple, right?!

TSEBEHTSKOOLTIDEHGUYXELCIHEVTEGRATEWDLUOHS

Best, Y
```

Solution:
```
Just reverse the code.

a = "TSEBEHTSKOOLTIDEHGUYXELCIHEVTEGRATEWDLUOHS"
print(a[::-1])
