### Corrupted

An agent in the field managed to get access to an **XML file** that he believes belonged to one of The Chopper gang members. It looks **corrupted** so he's sent it to us for analysis.

Have a **look in the file** and see if you can get it working.

**Tip:** The flag to complete the challenge is on the last line of the file.
