### Route into the Router

Good news, we've managed to get access to the login page for one of the gang's home routers. Useful... if only we knew the username and password. I wonder if they've been lazy and left the router's **default username and password** active? The router is just a standard Nethub 5000.

**Tip:** Find the correct username and password then login, to get the flag.

Search for 'Nethub 5000 default login' on 'moogle' and find default username and password.
