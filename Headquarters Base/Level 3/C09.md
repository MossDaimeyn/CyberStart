### Snake Charmer

We've just intercepted an email from one of the gang members with a file attached called "**passgen.py**". It looks like a **Python** script.

We've heard that the gang is looking for a way to make their passwords more secure, perhaps using code like this to generate them. See if you can **run the code** so we know exactly what it does.

**Tip:** The output from the code is the flag you need.

```
