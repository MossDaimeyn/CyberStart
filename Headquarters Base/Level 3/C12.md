### Dante In Command?

We **found a file** in an intercepted email from one of The Chopper gang members, Dante, but it needs to be **run from the command line** in order to make it work.

We think it might be a program the gang are writing to gain access to their competitors' computers, so it's important we check it out.

**Tip:** Run the program from the command line; the flag will be in the output.
