### Big Transfer

Agent, we've just intercepted a message between two of The Choppers talking about how they intend to steal money from the bank account of a different competitor to fund their plans.

It said they've found a weakness in the money transfer tool on the Global Bank website. **We've just successfully put through a test transfer**, can you prove it's vulnerable by transferring **1000** to a bank account called **cpatestreceiver** from **cpatestsender**.

**Tip:** Sometimes URLs can be manipulated to bypass security.
