### Secret Source

It looks like the gang has a lot of information we might find useful on their intranet; probably details of how they intend to break into their competitors' computer systems to look for the plans to their better felling machine. It would be especially useful if we could log in as their main developer, **Aksel**.

Sometimes developers can be a little bit lazy and leave **information** in the **source code** of a page that might be revealing. Perhaps you could take a look and see if there's anything Aksel left that might help you log in.

**Tip:** To get the challenge flag you need to successfully login.
