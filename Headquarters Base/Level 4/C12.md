### Bad Kitty

For weeks now The Chopper gang members have been passing animated GIFs of kittens backwards and forwards in a chat room app called KittyLitter. We thought they were just messing around, until one of our agents noticed something interesting in one of the GIFs.

Take a look at the GIFs in this message thread and see if you can figure out what it is. Oh, by the way, one of the agents mentioned there are websites and online tools to help you investigate fast-moving GIF files.

**Tip:** The flag is what you discover!

```
The gif 'challenge-kittylitter-cat-06.03d138da' looks suspicious. 
Covert this gif into jpg frames.
Now, we can clealy see the flag i.e., 85980
