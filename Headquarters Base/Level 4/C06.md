### Maggie's File

Our field agent has managed to get some login details from one of the gang, Magdalina. We believe she uses the details to SSH into a remote server to view a particular file that might be important.

These are the details we have:

**IP address:** 192.162.132.199  
**Username:** maggie  
**Password:** ubersecurepw

Why don't you try it yourself using the secure terminal we've provided and see what you find.

**Tip:** The terminal uses non-default implementation of OpenSSH and only accepts common formats. The flag is the name of the file.

```Starting restricted terminal

Terminal ready

agent@cpa$ ssh maggie@192.162.132.199
