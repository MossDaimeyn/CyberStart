Our team have been monitoring The Choppers' web traffic and it seems they've been spending a lot of time on a photo-sharing site, especially one particular page. Did you know you can hide a message inside a file? Maybe this image contains a hidden message. Why don't you take a look and see if you can find out?

**Tip:** The flag is in the image.
