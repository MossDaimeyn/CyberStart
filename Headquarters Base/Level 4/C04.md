### Upgrades? Paaa!

It looks like The Choppers know they need to improve their security set-up, as recently we've been unable to log in to their intranet and they've been making a few changes to their security.

They have rewritten their login form to use slightly improved JavaScript, but it doesn't seem to be much more secure. Maybe you could change some of the JavaScript on the login page to see if you can log us back in.

**Tip:** Log in successfully to get the flag.
