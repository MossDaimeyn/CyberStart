### Arnold Chopper?

A few days ago one of our field agents, who is now working undercover for The Choppers, found two pages of a book ripped out and left on a table.

We weren't sure if it meant anything, but then today we intercepted an email containing some cryptic code. It looks like the gang is getting smarter with its encrypted messages and is now using Arnold Ciphers.

See if you can use the intercepted code and the two pages of the book to discover what it means.

**Tip:** We believe the message contains a code, that's the flag.

Message:
