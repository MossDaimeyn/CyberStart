### Out Of Sight

Well, that's a bit of luck. We've managed to get our hands on some details that allowed us to SSH into one of the Yakoottees private servers. They're a sophisticated gang, so they've probably hidden a few files in there. We've got you into their server, have a look and see if you can find anything.

**Tip:** The flag is in a file somewhere on the server.
