### Yakoo Cars

The Yakoottees aren't just a criminal gang, they're also a group of talented car engineers. Their organisation has a front - a high-end car repair shop called Yakoo Cars.

Naturally, we took a thorough look through their website to see if we could find anything interesting. One thing we found was a little strange: an empty page. Empty, apart from a message saying "Error. Cookie `user` expected.". Ordinarily we wouldn't think anything of it, but the page name is "Secret", so we should investigate.

We think only the boss Yaka Matsu should have access. Take a look and see if you can get around the cookie issue.
