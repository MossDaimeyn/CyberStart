### Shinji's Drone

Yesterday we spotted a Yakoottees gang member checking out the Superspin HQ, seemingly on a reconnaissance mission. He was seen flying a drone around the building with a video camera attached to it and we've since discovered that he put that video up on his personal site to share with other gang members. We know his username is "shinji" - if we could get in and take a look at the video, we might know better where they intend to target.

Check out the login page on his site and see if you can break in.
