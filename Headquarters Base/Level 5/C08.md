### Rattlesnake

Well, one thing is for sure, the Yakoottees' scripting language of choice is Python. We've intercepted a lot of Python files from all over the place. So many, in fact, that we need someone to look at them and see what they do. Can have a look at this one to find out what it does?

**Tip:** The flag is in the file.

flag.py :
```python
from os import remove

from sys import argv

  

# THE FLAG IS: 8&0QA0Vd%&9x4Jx

print("Deleting " + argv[0])

remove(argv[0])
```
 
 
 ```
 Therefore, THE FLAG IS: 8&0QA0Vd%&9x4Jx
 ```
