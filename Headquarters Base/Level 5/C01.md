### Perplexed By Pixels

The Yakoottees love their cars. And so you'd expect that they might send each other car photos, images and even art. But recently we intercepted something strange: a pixel drawing of a car. What's strange about it? One of the gang, Kanako, sent two copies of it to another gang member. After some initial analysis we noticed some slight variations in colour in a selection of pixels.

One of the team has already built a comparison tool but he's just been reassigned to another urgent project. Perhaps you could take a look at what he's built and finish the analysis.

**Tip:** Calculate the differences, convert it with the ASCII table, and that's your flag

```
|(30+25+31)-(0+0+0)| = 86 == V
|(186+29+65)-(176+23+0)| = 81 == Q
|(17+71+77)-(0+69+21)| = 75 == K
|(120+124+123)-(161+149+124)| = 67 == C
|(255+177+39)-(255+126+0)| = 90 == Z

```
